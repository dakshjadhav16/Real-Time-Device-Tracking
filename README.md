# Realtime Device Tracking with Maps 🚀
This project is a real-time device tracking system that combines Node.js, Express, Socket.IO, and Leaflet.js to provide live updates of device locations on an interactive map
Features

    📡 Real-Time Updates: Tracks devices and updates their locations in real-time using WebSocket communication.
    🗺️ Interactive Map: Displays device locations on a dynamic map with Leaflet.js.
    🌐 Scalable Backend: Built with Node.js and Express for high performance and scalability.
    🔄 Customizable: Easily extendable to include features like geofencing, historical data storage, and device grouping.

Tech Stack

    Backend: Node.js, Express, Socket.IO
    Frontend: Leaflet.js, HTML, CSS
    Optional Add-ons: MongoDB or Redis for location history and caching.
    
How It Works

    Devices send their location to the backend server via WebSocket.
    The server broadcasts the updated location to all connected clients.
    The frontend displays live device positions on an interactive map.
